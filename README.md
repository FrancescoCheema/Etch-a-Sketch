# Etch-a-Sketch
I bult this etch a sketch project using:
CSS Flexbox,
CSS Animation,
Dom Manipulation,
Event Listeners,
Query Selectors,
Sizing with colums and rows.
The project is quite particular, as it's my first time playing with a grid, making sure the outcome is exactly as I want it to look like.
